# System Overview

RealNews Free Publish Core is a modular, censorship‑resistant publishing infrastructure composed of five integrated subsystems:

1. **Access Layer**  
   A unified entry point built on six advanced anti‑censorship protocols (Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, XHTTP).

2. **Emergency Publishing Channel**  
   A secure pipeline for anonymous, encrypted, metadata‑stripped content submission and multi‑mirror distribution.

3. **News Aggregation Module**  
   A resilient RSS and mirror‑based aggregator for independent journalism.

4. **Anonymous BBS**  
   A lightweight, privacy‑preserving discussion board for low‑risk community interaction.

5. **Secure Uploader**  
   A safe channel for transmitting sensitive media and documents to external platforms or decentralized storage.

Each subsystem is independently deployable and designed for modular integration. The architecture prioritizes user anonymity, transport camouflage, decentralized persistence, and long‑term content survivability.
