The Emergency Publishing Channel interface defines all external and internal APIs used for secure, anonymous, censorship‑resistant content submission. The submission API uses POST /submit with headers Authorization: Bearer <token> and X-Anonymous-ID, and the body includes encrypted payload, type, and timestamp; the server responds with {"status":"ok","submission_id":"<uuid>"} to confirm receipt without linking to user identity. Mirror nodes synchronize content via POST /mirror/sync with node_id and last_sync, receiving a list of encrypted items with submission_id, payload, type, and timestamp. Trusted NGO/media partners retrieve sanitized, verified submissions through GET /distribution/feed with optional since and limit parameters, receiving items containing submission_id, sanitized content, type, mirror list, IPFS CID, and timestamp. Internal interfaces include Sanitizer.strip_metadata and Sanitizer.normalize for metadata removal and format normalization; Router.select_nodes and Router.fallback for multi‑node routing; Storage.store_local, Storage.store_ipfs, and Storage.store_arweave for encrypted storage; and Distributor.push_to_partners and Distributor.update_public_mirrors for distributing content to NGO/media endpoints and public mirrors. All interfaces are designed to preserve anonymity, ensure encrypted handling, support multi‑mirror resilience, and maintain long‑term content survivability.
