# Emergency Channel — Analytics Module

## 1. Purpose

The Analytics Module provides non-intrusive, aggregated insights into the operation of the Emergency Channel.  
It focuses on system performance, content distribution patterns, and resource utilization, without tracking individual users.  
Analytics is used for optimization, reliability improvements, and capacity planning, not for user profiling or behavioral targeting.
