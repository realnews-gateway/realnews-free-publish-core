## Pipeline Overview

The Emergency Channel Pipeline defines the end‑to‑end processing sequence for all incoming submissions. It ensures that every piece of content passes through a consistent, secure, and verifiable workflow before reaching storage or distribution layers.

The pipeline is designed to operate under hostile network conditions, guaranteeing anonymity, integrity, and resilience throughout the entire submission lifecycle.
