## Validation Overview

The Validation module ensures that all incoming submissions meet the minimum structural, security, and format requirements before entering the main processing pipeline. It acts as the first defensive layer, preventing malformed, dangerous, or suspicious payloads from reaching downstream components.

Validation is intentionally strict to protect the system from adversarial inputs, corrupted files, and metadata‑bearing formats that could compromise user anonymity.
