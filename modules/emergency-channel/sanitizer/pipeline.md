## Sanitization Pipeline Overview

The Sanitizer Pipeline defines the full sequence of operations applied to incoming content to ensure complete metadata removal, fingerprint neutralization, and format normalization. Each stage runs inside an isolated sandbox and produces deterministic, correlation‑resistant output.

The pipeline is designed to handle text, images, videos, and documents using format‑specific routines while maintaining strict anonymity guarantees.
