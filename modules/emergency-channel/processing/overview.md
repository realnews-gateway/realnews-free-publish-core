## Processing Module Overview

The Processing module is responsible for transforming sanitized content into structured, verifiable, and distribution‑ready artifacts. It performs classification, deduplication, integrity verification, and content enrichment while preserving strict anonymity guarantees.

All processing operations occur after sanitization and operate exclusively on metadata‑free content. The module never attempts to infer identity, origin, or device characteristics from submissions.
