## Classification Module Overview

The Classification module is responsible for determining the semantic category of sanitized content. It operates exclusively on metadata‑free inputs and uses deterministic, lightweight heuristics to assign a normalized classification tag.

The module must never infer identity, origin, authorship, or device characteristics. Its sole purpose is to categorize content for downstream processing, routing, and distribution.
