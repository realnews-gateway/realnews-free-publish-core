# Publisher Module — Pipeline

## Overview

The Publisher pipeline is responsible for transforming sanitized content into publishable artifacts and delivering them across multiple external channels.  
It ensures reliability, redundancy, and censorship‑resistant delivery while maintaining strict metadata hygiene.

The pipeline is designed to be modular, allowing new publishing channels to be added without affecting upstream components.
