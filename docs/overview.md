# Project Overview

RealNews Gateway is designed to provide secure access to independent news and public information in regions with heavy censorship.  
It integrates a VPN access layer, a news aggregation system, a lightweight anonymous discussion board, and a secure uploader for external platforms.

The project is open-source under AGPLv3, ensuring transparency, auditability, and public benefit.
