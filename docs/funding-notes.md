# Funding Notes (For Grant Reviewers)

This repository represents the open-source core of the RealNews Gateway project.  
It contains the architecture, documentation, and module definitions required for transparent evaluation and public benefit.

## Alignment with Media Freedom and Democratic Resilience

RealNews Gateway directly supports:

- Access to independent journalism  
- Circumvention of state-level censorship  
- Secure distribution of public-interest content  
- Community-driven information resilience  
- Protection of non-technical users in high-risk environments  

The project lowers the barrier for ordinary users to access modern anti-censorship technologies by integrating Hysteria2, Reality, VLESS, Trojan, XTLS, and XHTTP into a unified, beginner-friendly access layer.

## Why Funding Is Needed

While the core architecture is open-source, funding is required for:

- Development of the VPN access layer  
- News aggregation and mirroring infrastructure  
- Anonymous BBS implementation  
- Secure uploader integration  
- Documentation, testing, and security review  
- Deployment support for NGOs and independent media  

## Sustainability

RealNews Gateway is designed to be:

- Open-source  
- Auditable  
- Modular  
- Community-hostable  
- Independent of commercial proxy providers  

This ensures long-term sustainability and reduces the risks associated with airport-style subscription services, including provider shutdowns and user financial loss.

## Project Readiness

This repository demonstrates:

- Clear architecture  
- Defined modules  
- Realistic roadmap  
- Strong technical foundation  
- Alignment with funder priorities  

The project is ready for execution under a 3–6 month development cycle with appropriate support.
